Code for implementing SCAN model - demonstrating how movement of place
cells can control movement of grid cells forming an attractor manifold.

Code generated for Morris & Deridkman, TICS, 2023
The code is modified from code for Agmon and Burak, eLife, 2020

Two folders:
Place to grid model - demonstrate on a 2D trajectory how place cells movement can move the grid cell manifold
1D spatially modulated to place and grid - generate spatially modualted cells and use them to move the place cells, which in turn move the grid cells
